REVIEW OF ACTIONS

* Tom
  * propose approach using Github for long-term community-driven maintenance of
    CI, based on Schema.org
  * remind Tom Johnson to review Ruby competencies
  * competencies about topic maps - Tom has proposed two competencies to Sam Oh
  * Re-add Linked Data applications as per Stuart's suggestion on June 3

* Debbie
  * contact Ryan about competencies for "temporarily indexed data" (and
    looking at the CI in general), with a link to PERIODO work.
    - they are working on it
  * SPARQL endpoints and triple stores (will ask on their listserv)
    - continues

* Stuart:
  * write Diane re: cleaning data
    - Stuart has written
  * go back to Euclid project re: LD Application Architecture
    - we eliminated the topic Linked Data (see above)
  * SPARQL endpoints and triple stores (will ask Joseph Chapman)
    - continues
  * ping Seth and Ruben (or Stuart flesh out from their webinars)
    - I pinged them

* Magnus
  * http://www.slideshare.net/EUCLIDproject/building-linked-data-applications-27768679
    - Magnus will propose competencies

* Kai
  * write provenance competency about differentiating simple approach and
    representing the chain
    - see proposal above - will add versioning

* Sean:
  * contact Barry Norton and Elena Simperl, formerly of the EUCLID Project and
    currently teaching a Future Learn MOOC, "Introduction to Linked Data and
    the Semantic Web".

======================================================================
REMAINING GAPS

* Non-RDF linked data (note the lowercase) - last entry under "Fundamentals of Linked Data"
  * Microdata - syntactically different from RDF
  * Graph databases, such as Neo4j.
  * Topic Maps (Tom sent draft to Sam Oh for comment)

* Versioning RDF data and RDF data provenance
  * Kai proposal (will make pull request)

* Assessing RDF data quality
  * Diane (Stuart)

* Storing RDF data
  * SPARQL endpoints (Debbie)
  * Triple stores (Debbie)

PROPOSALS to May 14 release - http://tinyurl.com/ld4pe-competencies-may14

* Under Fundamentals of Linked Data, Melanie Wacker proposes:
  * Understands purposes and goals of Linked Data [But asks: Or is that implied in this benchmark?]

* Unclear where...  Melanie Wacker proposes:
  * Add benchmark: Knows relevant tools for cleaning and reconciling data?

* Given:

    Interacting with RDF Data
      Finding RDF Data
        Knows relevant resources for discovering existing Linked Data datasets.
          Retrieves and accesses RDF data from the "open Web".

  Melanie Wacker asks: "Not sure if this logically follows from knowing how and
  where to find relevant resources for discovering Linked Data datasets. Maybe
  more closely related to Querying RDF data?"
